### Fix /api/referral 405 — Convert Pages Function to Astro server endpoint — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20

`/api/referral` was returning 405 in production. Root cause: `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter generates `dist/server/entry.mjs` (a Worker), and when Cloudflare Pages sees a Worker, the `functions/` directory is bypassed entirely. The Worker had no route for `/api/referral`.

- [x] A. Diagnosed root cause: Worker from Cloudflare adapter takes over all routing; `functions/api/referral.ts` (Pages Function) was dead code
- [x] B. Created `apps/web/src/pages/api/referral.ts` — Astro server endpoint with `export const prerender = false`, `POST: APIRoute`, `OPTIONS: APIRoute`; env via `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'`
- [x] C. Confirmed `cloudflare:workers` import builds successfully (no fallback needed)
- [x] D. Verified `dist/server/chunks/referral_*.mjs` exists — handler is in the Worker bundle
- [x] E. Deleted `apps/web/functions/api/referral.ts` and empty `functions/api/` + `functions/` directories
- [x] F. Confirmed `resident-referral.astro` already fetches `/api/referral` — no change needed
- [x] G. `pnpm --filter web build` — PASSED (20 routes, 0 errors)

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (Fix /api/referral 405)

**Root cause:** The `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter (even in `output: 'static'` mode) compiles the site into a Cloudflare Worker (`dist/server/entry.mjs`). Cloudflare Pages has a hard rule: when a Worker is present (`_worker.js` pattern), Pages Functions (`functions/` directory) are bypassed. The Worker served static assets from `dist/client/` but had no route for `/api/referral`, producing 405.

**Fix:** Moved the handler from `functions/api/referral.ts` (Pages Functions format) to `src/pages/api/referral.ts` (Astro server endpoint format). The Astro Cloudflare adapter compiles this file into the Worker bundle, making it reachable as `/api/referral`.

**Env var access:** `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'` built cleanly — no fallback to `locals.runtime.env` was needed.

**Files changed:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/api/referral.ts` (new) — Astro server endpoint; identical HubSpot 6-step logic; `POST: APIRoute` + `OPTIONS: APIRoute`; `prerender = false`
- `apps/web/functions/api/referral.ts` (deleted)
- `apps/web/functions/api/` (deleted — empty)
- `apps/web/functions/` (deleted — empty)

**All business logic preserved verbatim:** company search/create, referrer upsert, patient upsert, guardian create, all 5 associations, CORS headers, per-step try/catch with step name in error response.

**Verification:** `pnpm --filter web build` PASS — 20 routes, 0 errors. `dist/server/chunks/referral_*.mjs` confirmed in server bundle with `HUBSPOT_BASE`, `HUBSPOT_SERVICE_KEY`, and all HubSpot endpoint URLs present. `functions/` directory confirmed deleted.

### Add draft persistence to resident referral form — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20

Persist all form field values to localStorage so a page refresh before submission restores the user's work.

- [x] A. Added `DRAFT_KEY`, `DRAFT_TTL`, `debounceTimer` vars after `selectedFiles` declaration
- [x] B. Added `saveDraft()` — 500ms debounce; reads 12 text/tel/email/textarea fields + checked skilledNursing radio; writes `{ ts, fields }` JSON to `localStorage`
- [x] C. Added `clearDraft()` — removes key; try/catch guarded
- [x] D. Added `restoreDraft()` — reads draft on load; evicts if `> 1h` old; populates all 12 inputs and matching radio
- [x] E. Attached `input` listeners to all 12 text/email/tel/textarea fields; `change` listeners to both radio inputs
- [x] F. Called `restoreDraft()` at init; `clearDraft()` on successful submission (before hiding form)
- [x] G. Not persisted: `docUpload` (file), `hipaaConsent` (checkbox — user must re-consent each session)
- [x] H. `pnpm --filter web build` — PASSED (20 routes, 0 errors); all 7 symbols confirmed in `dist/client/resident-referral/index.html`

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (Draft persistence)

**What was built:** localStorage draft persistence for the resident referral form. All changes are inside the existing `<script is:inline>` block — no new files created.

**Files changed:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/resident-referral.astro` — 3 targeted edits to the inline script only; no HTML, CSS, or form structure changed

**Implementation details:**

| TTL              | 1 hour (`Date.now() - draft.ts > 3600000`)                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Stale draft handling:** If `ts` is missing or draft is unparseable, function returns silently. If older than 1h, `clearDraft()` is called and function returns — no partial restore.

**Verification:** Build PASS — 20 routes, 0 errors. Grep confirmed all 7 symbols (`DRAFT_KEY`, `DRAFT_TTL`, `saveDraft`, `clearDraft`, `restoreDraft`, `PERSIST_IDS`, `debounceTimer`) present in `dist/client/resident-referral/index.html` at expected lines.

**Issues:** None. No user corrections this session.

### Remove Cloudflare adapter → static output + Pages Function referral — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20 14:10

Context: Previous session added the Cloudflare adapter to route `/api/referral` via a Worker. New plan (Option D): remove the adapter entirely, run pure static output, and put the referral handler in `functions/api/referral.ts` (Cloudflare Pages Function). With no `_worker.js` present, Cloudflare Pages will serve Pages Functions from `functions/`.

- [x] A. STEP 1 — Edit `apps/web/astro.config.mjs`: remove adapter import + config, keep `output: 'static'`; also removed `studioBasePath`/`studioRouterHistory` (Sanity Studio embedded route requires `@astrojs/react` or SSR adapter — removed since Studio is separately deployed)
- [x] B. STEP 1 — Run `pnpm remove @astrojs/cloudflare --filter web`
- [x] C. STEP 2 — Edit `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`: remove `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'`; simplified to one-line passthrough
- [x] D. STEP 3 — Delete `apps/web/src/pages/api/referral.ts` and empty `api/` directory
- [x] E. STEP 4 — Create `functions/api/referral.ts` at repo root with Pages Function format + full HubSpot logic
- [x] F. STEP 5 — `resident-referral.astro` line 992 confirmed: `fetch('/api/referral', ...)` — no change needed
- [x] G. STEP 6 — `pnpm --filter web build` PASS — 19 routes, 0 errors, no `_worker.js`/`entry.mjs`/`server/` in dist/
- [x] H. Reported build results to Igor; Igor approved and said "Push"

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (Remove adapter + Pages Function referral)

**What was built:** Removed `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter entirely. Site now builds as pure static output. Referral handler moved from Astro server endpoint (`src/pages/api/referral.ts`) to Cloudflare Pages Function (`functions/api/referral.ts` at repo root). With no `_worker.js` in dist/, Cloudflare Pages will route `/api/referral` to the Pages Function.

**Files changed:**

- `apps/web/astro.config.mjs` — removed `import cloudflare` + `adapter: cloudflare()`; removed `studioBasePath` (Studio route requires `@astrojs/react` or SSR adapter; Studio is separately deployed)
- `apps/web/package.json` — `@astrojs/cloudflare` removed from dependencies
- `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` — removed `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'`; replaced 109-line Sanity redirect logic with a one-line passthrough (redirect logic required Cloudflare runtime; static output has no runtime)
- `apps/web/src/pages/api/referral.ts` — deleted (Astro server endpoint format; invalid without adapter)
- `functions/api/referral.ts` — created at repo root; `onRequestPost` + `onRequestOptions` in Pages Function format; full HubSpot 6-step logic preserved verbatim; `env.HUBSPOT_SERVICE_KEY` from `context.env`

**Side effect — `/admin` removed:** The embedded Sanity Studio at `/admin` is no longer served by the Astro site. Igor must use the external Sanity Studio URL. Route count: 20 → 19.

**Verification:** `pnpm --filter web build` PASS — 19 routes, 0 errors. `find dist/ -name "_worker.js" -o -name "entry.mjs"` → empty. `dist/server/` → does not exist. All 19 HTML files confirmed in `dist/`.

**Issues:** None. No user corrections this session.

### Add refer_source + website_form to all HubSpot contact creation calls — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20 (pre)

Add `refer_source: 'Website Form'` and `website_form: 'Refer Resident'` to every HubSpot contact property object in `functions/api/referral.ts`.

- [x] A. Added both properties to `referrerProps` (Step 2, line ~260)
- [x] B. Added both properties to `patientProps` (Step 3, line ~289)
- [x] C. Added both properties to `guardianProps` (Step 4, line ~313)

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (refer_source + website_form)

**What was built:** Two new HubSpot contact properties added to all 3 contact creation points in `functions/api/referral.ts`. Every contact created by the referral form (referrer, patient, guardian) now sends `refer_source: "Website Form"` and `website_form: "Refer Resident"`.

**Files changed:**

- `functions/api/referral.ts` — 3 targeted edits to `referrerProps`, `patientProps`, `guardianProps`; no logic, no structure changed

**Verification:** Build check below. No user corrections this session.

### Archive todo.md + consolidate lessons.md — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20

Cleanup: archive 1823 lines of completed tasks from todo.md to todo-archive.md; reduce lessons.md from 25 to 23 lessons by removing Lesson 15 and merging Lessons 17+23.

- [x] A. Appended lines 28–1851 of todo.md (all completed tasks through 2026-05-19) to `tasks/todo-archive.md` with archive notice header
- [x] B. Rewrote `tasks/todo.md` to header + two 2026-05-20 tasks only (98 lines, down from 1923)
- [x] C. Removed Lesson 15 ("The tasks/ directory that counts is in the git repo") — key point absorbed into Lesson 22 (working directory)
- [x] D. Merged Lessons 17+23 into new Lesson 21 ("All verification claims require evidence — grep before reporting, no contradictions")
- [x] E. Renumbered all lessons — 23 total, continuous 1–23
- [x] F. Verified: `grep -c "^### [0-9]" tasks/lessons.md` → 23

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (Cleanup)

**What changed:**

- `tasks/todo.md` — 1923 → 98 lines; only header + 3 completed task blocks remain
- `tasks/todo-archive.md` — 2625 → 4454 lines; 1829-line batch appended with date notice
- `tasks/lessons.md` — 254 → 244 lines; 25 → 23 lessons

**Consolidation rationale:**

- Lesson 15 removed: "The tasks/ directory that counts is in the git repo" — its core point ("never write to a stale clone's tasks/") is already covered by Lesson 22's "Stale clones — NEVER use" section and the RULE 0 working directory rule. Keeping both created redundancy without adding signal.
- Lessons 17+23 merged: both addressed the same failure mode (claiming a change is done without actual file evidence). Lesson 17 covered checklist contradictions; Lesson 23 covered grep-before-reporting. The merged Lesson 21 covers both angles: no contradictions AND grep proof required.

**Verification:** `wc -l` confirmed file sizes. `grep -c "^### [0-9]"` → 23 lessons exactly.
