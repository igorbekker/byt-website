### Fix /api/referral 405 — Convert Pages Function to Astro server endpoint — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20

`/api/referral` was returning 405 in production. Root cause: `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter generates `dist/server/entry.mjs` (a Worker), and when Cloudflare Pages sees a Worker, the `functions/` directory is bypassed entirely. The Worker had no route for `/api/referral`.

- [x] A. Diagnosed root cause: Worker from Cloudflare adapter takes over all routing; `functions/api/referral.ts` (Pages Function) was dead code
- [x] B. Created `apps/web/src/pages/api/referral.ts` — Astro server endpoint with `export const prerender = false`, `POST: APIRoute`, `OPTIONS: APIRoute`; env via `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'`
- [x] C. Confirmed `cloudflare:workers` import builds successfully (no fallback needed)
- [x] D. Verified `dist/server/chunks/referral_*.mjs` exists — handler is in the Worker bundle
- [x] E. Deleted `apps/web/functions/api/referral.ts` and empty `functions/api/` + `functions/` directories
- [x] F. Confirmed `resident-referral.astro` already fetches `/api/referral` — no change needed
- [x] G. `pnpm --filter web build` — PASSED (20 routes, 0 errors)

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (Fix /api/referral 405)

**Root cause:** The `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter (even in `output: 'static'` mode) compiles the site into a Cloudflare Worker (`dist/server/entry.mjs`). Cloudflare Pages has a hard rule: when a Worker is present (`_worker.js` pattern), Pages Functions (`functions/` directory) are bypassed. The Worker served static assets from `dist/client/` but had no route for `/api/referral`, producing 405.

**Fix:** Moved the handler from `functions/api/referral.ts` (Pages Functions format) to `src/pages/api/referral.ts` (Astro server endpoint format). The Astro Cloudflare adapter compiles this file into the Worker bundle, making it reachable as `/api/referral`.

**Env var access:** `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'` built cleanly — no fallback to `locals.runtime.env` was needed.

**Files changed:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/api/referral.ts` (new) — Astro server endpoint; identical HubSpot 6-step logic; `POST: APIRoute` + `OPTIONS: APIRoute`; `prerender = false`
- `apps/web/functions/api/referral.ts` (deleted)
- `apps/web/functions/api/` (deleted — empty)
- `apps/web/functions/` (deleted — empty)

**All business logic preserved verbatim:** company search/create, referrer upsert, patient upsert, guardian create, all 5 associations, CORS headers, per-step try/catch with step name in error response.

**Verification:** `pnpm --filter web build` PASS — 20 routes, 0 errors. `dist/server/chunks/referral_*.mjs` confirmed in server bundle with `HUBSPOT_BASE`, `HUBSPOT_SERVICE_KEY`, and all HubSpot endpoint URLs present. `functions/` directory confirmed deleted.

### Add draft persistence to resident referral form — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20

Persist all form field values to localStorage so a page refresh before submission restores the user's work.

- [x] A. Added `DRAFT_KEY`, `DRAFT_TTL`, `debounceTimer` vars after `selectedFiles` declaration
- [x] B. Added `saveDraft()` — 500ms debounce; reads 12 text/tel/email/textarea fields + checked skilledNursing radio; writes `{ ts, fields }` JSON to `localStorage`
- [x] C. Added `clearDraft()` — removes key; try/catch guarded
- [x] D. Added `restoreDraft()` — reads draft on load; evicts if `> 1h` old; populates all 12 inputs and matching radio
- [x] E. Attached `input` listeners to all 12 text/email/tel/textarea fields; `change` listeners to both radio inputs
- [x] F. Called `restoreDraft()` at init; `clearDraft()` on successful submission (before hiding form)
- [x] G. Not persisted: `docUpload` (file), `hipaaConsent` (checkbox — user must re-consent each session)
- [x] H. `pnpm --filter web build` — PASSED (20 routes, 0 errors); all 7 symbols confirmed in `dist/client/resident-referral/index.html`

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (Draft persistence)

**What was built:** localStorage draft persistence for the resident referral form. All changes are inside the existing `<script is:inline>` block — no new files created.

**Files changed:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/resident-referral.astro` — 3 targeted edits to the inline script only; no HTML, CSS, or form structure changed

**Implementation details:**

| Clear trigger    | First line of success handler, before `form.hidden = true`                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Stale draft handling:** If `ts` is missing or draft is unparseable, function returns silently. If older than 1h, `clearDraft()` is called and function returns — no partial restore.

**Verification:** Build PASS — 20 routes, 0 errors. Grep confirmed all 7 symbols (`DRAFT_KEY`, `DRAFT_TTL`, `saveDraft`, `clearDraft`, `restoreDraft`, `PERSIST_IDS`, `debounceTimer`) present in `dist/client/resident-referral/index.html` at expected lines.

**Issues:** None. No user corrections this session.

### Archive todo.md + consolidate lessons.md — 2026-05-20 [x] COMPLETE 2026-05-20

Cleanup: archive 1823 lines of completed tasks from todo.md to todo-archive.md; reduce lessons.md from 25 to 23 lessons by removing Lesson 15 and merging Lessons 17+23.

- [x] A. Appended lines 28–1851 of todo.md (all completed tasks through 2026-05-19) to `tasks/todo-archive.md` with archive notice header
- [x] B. Rewrote `tasks/todo.md` to header + two 2026-05-20 tasks only (98 lines, down from 1923)
- [x] C. Removed Lesson 15 ("The tasks/ directory that counts is in the git repo") — key point absorbed into Lesson 22 (working directory)
- [x] D. Merged Lessons 17+23 into new Lesson 21 ("All verification claims require evidence — grep before reporting, no contradictions")
- [x] E. Renumbered all lessons — 23 total, continuous 1–23
- [x] F. Verified: `grep -c "^### [0-9]" tasks/lessons.md` → 23

### Session Review — 2026-05-20 (Cleanup)

**What changed:**

- `tasks/todo.md` — 1923 → 98 lines; only header + 3 completed task blocks remain
- `tasks/todo-archive.md` — 2625 → 4454 lines; 1829-line batch appended with date notice
- `tasks/lessons.md` — 254 → 244 lines; 25 → 23 lessons

**Consolidation rationale:**

- Lesson 15 removed: "The tasks/ directory that counts is in the git repo" — its core point ("never write to a stale clone's tasks/") is already covered by Lesson 22's "Stale clones — NEVER use" section and the RULE 0 working directory rule. Keeping both created redundancy without adding signal.
- Lessons 17+23 merged: both addressed the same failure mode (claiming a change is done without actual file evidence). Lesson 17 covered checklist contradictions; Lesson 23 covered grep-before-reporting. The merged Lesson 21 covers both angles: no contradictions AND grep proof required.

**Verification:** `wc -l` confirmed file sizes. `grep -c "^### [0-9]"` → 23 lessons exactly.
